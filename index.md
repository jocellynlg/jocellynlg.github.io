Hello! I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.espol.edu.ec/es" target="_blank">ESPOL</a> university with a focus on AI-driven solutions for smart energy systems. I’m currently involved in Analítica e Inteligencia Artificial para Sostenibilidad (AIAS), a cutting-edge initiative that combines data analytics and AI models to create sustainable solutions for energy resources. You can learn more about AIAS <a href="https://aias.espol.edu.ec/" target="_blank">here</a>.

My work centers on developing AI techniques for forecasting, optimization, and smart grid applications, particularly in high-renewable energy contexts. Methodologically, I am exploring how machine learning and remote sensing can advance the efficient and sustainable management of energy resources.

For prospective collaborations, please feel free to reach out, especially if your interests align with AI for energy, sustainable technologies, or data science.
